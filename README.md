## Introduction
This application is a Online Discussion Forum built with gradle.
The global population is increasing rapidly. And we need more
food and other products to meet up this huge demand. Traditional
farming canâ€™t feed up these demands and we must have to use modern
farming methods. Modern farming can also be a great source of
employment and income. The unemployed people can start agribusiness.
Thus we can make a strong economy and hunger free world. One of the major challenges we identified while working with farmers in India is an information gap and ease of access to that information.

## Getting Started

The web application is made up of three parts: database, backend  (Spring)
and frontend (React).The application can run directly via Gradle. The code for this application uses the Gradle build tool (https://gradle.org.). Instructions for
installing Gradle are available in the official documentation(https://gradle.org/install)
which describes several options.

The User have to register and login.

## Front-end React
Front-end for this application is built with Create React App.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm start

```

_If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, its recommended to uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version._

_[npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher._

_Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the application.<br>_


## How to Run the Application
The application can also be run via terminal with the Gradle.

```
./gradlew bootRun
```
To Stop Running the Application:

```
Crtl + C
```
## Setup
We need to configure the following dependencies in `build.gradle`:

```Dependencies:
plugins {
	id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.2.0.RELEASE'
	id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.8.RELEASE'
	id 'java'
}

group = 'se.kth.sda'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
sourceCompatibility = '11'

configurations {
	developmentOnly
	runtimeClasspath {
		extendsFrom developmentOnly
	}
}

repositories {
	mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
	implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
	implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
	implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf'
	implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
	developmentOnly 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools'
	compile group: 'com.auth0', name: 'java-jwt', version: '3.8.3'
	runtimeOnly 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
}

```

`src/main/resources/application.properties` should be configured:
```properties
spring.jpa.database=POSTGRESQL
spring.datasource.platform=postgres
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5431/skeleton
spring.datasource.username=skeleton_user
spring.datasource.password=skeleton_pass
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true
```
## DataBase Setup
A Dockerized PostgreSQL database:

The docker-compose.yaml is manually created.
To create docker-compose from the terminal ,we need to use the command
```touch docker-compose.yaml ```

and docker-compose.yaml should contain the following.
```docker-compose.yaml
version: "3"
services:
database:
image: postgres:13-alpine
environment:
- POSTGRES_DB=skeleton
- POSTGRES_USER=skeleton_user
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD=skeleton_pass
ports:
- "5431:5432"
volumes:
- db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
db-data:
```

## Docker Commands
1.Start container
```
docker-compose up
```
2.Stop container
```
docker-compose down
```
3.List all Running Containers
```
docker ps
```
4.Enter the Running Container
```
docker-compose exec database /bin/sh
```
5.(psql Commands) While inside a postgres container, enter the postgres database.
```
psql skeleton skeleton_user
```
6.psql Commands (when inside the database)
Connect to DataBase:
```bash
\c
```
7.Show the tables in the database
```bash
\dt
```
8.Show all rows in particular table
