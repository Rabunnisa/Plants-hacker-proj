                <h2>Importance of Agriculture</h2>
                <p>
                    The global population is increasing rapidly. And we need more food and other products to meet up this huge demand. Traditional farming canâ€™t feed up these demands and we must have to use modern farming methods. Modern farming can also be a great source of employment and income. The unemployed people can start agribusiness. Thus we can make a strong economy and hunger free world. One of the major challenges we identified while working with farmers in India is an information gap and ease of access to that information. Each time we explained and questions kept streaming as to where to access inputs/services, how to plant or to control a certain farming problem.
                    This is how Indian plants Hacker Forum came to be. A one stop farming information platform that offers ease of access to current farming information in a simplified and interactive way through the our discussion forum.
